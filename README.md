. Open Playlists;
. Save Playlists;
. Repeat media;
. Shuffle media.

An Equalizer which includes:

. Pre-Amp;
. 10 different band sliders to adjust the sound quality.

A Mini Player:

Full screen controls:

. So you can control your display while watching videos in full screen.

As always after installing any theme/skin remember to restart VLC.
