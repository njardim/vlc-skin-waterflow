**VLC skin: Waterflow**

A lot of useful features have been integrated into this version, and so it should run smoothly and be stable in all current versions of VLC.

The interface has been redesigned to match high quality standards, so it looks nice, clean, and fluid.

1. Add new media;
2. Remove media;
3. Open Playlists;
4. Save Playlists;
5. Repeat media;
6. Shuffle media.

**An Equalizer which includes:**

1. A Pre-Amp;
2. A full range of 10 different band sliders to adjust the sound quality.

**A Mini Player:**

1. The Mini Player boosts all control features in a very cool and out-of-your way convenient new interface.

**Full screen controls:**

1. The full-screen controler was rebuilt so that now you can take full control of your viewing experience while watching on full screen.


As always, after installing any theme or skin, remember to restart VLC.
